## Introduction

The IKEA Retail Sales SQL Project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze retail data, including **sales records**, **store performance**, **product trends**, and **inventory status**. Using a robust schema, this project answers critical business questions and provides actionable insights to optimize IKEA's operational efficiency and profitability.

---

## Project Structure

1. **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL queries to create the database schema, populate tables, and perform analyses.
2. **Dataset**: Includes sales data, product information, store details, and inventory records.
3. **Analysis**: SQL queries solve key business problems, leveraging advanced SQL techniques like joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

---

## Database Schema

### 1. **Products Table**
- **product_id**: Unique identifier for each product (Primary Key).
- **product_name**: Name of the product.
- **category**: Category to which the product belongs.
- **subcategory**: Subcategory of the product.
- **unit_price**: Price per unit of the product.

### 2. **Stores Table**
- **store_id**: Unique identifier for each store (Primary Key).
- **store_name**: Name of the store.
- **city**: City where the store is located.
- **country**: Country where the store operates.

### 3. **Sales Table**
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each sales order (Primary Key).
- **order_date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **product_id**: Foreign key referencing the `products` table.
- **qty**: Quantity of the product sold.
- **discount_percentage**: Discount applied to the order.
- **unit_price**: Price per unit of the product at the time of sale.
- **store_id**: Foreign key referencing the `stores` table.

### 4. **Inventory Table**
- **inventory_id**: Unique identifier for each inventory record (Primary Key).
- **product_id**: Foreign key referencing the `products` table.
- **current_stock**: Current stock level of the product.
- **reorder_level**: Minimum stock level to trigger a reorder.

## Business Problems

This project tackles the following business problems:

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Easy Level:

### 1. List Customers and Products Purchased
**Skill Used:** INNER JOIN, ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN products p ON p.product_id = s.product_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

---

### 2. Find Orders without Shipping Records
**Skill Used:** LEFT JOIN, NULL handling

```sql
SELECT s.order_id, s.product_id, sp.shipping_id, sp.delivery_status
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN shippings sp ON sp.order_id = s.order_id
ORDER BY 3;
```

---

### 3. Categorize Store Performance Based on Sales
**Skill Used:** GROUP BY, CASE WHEN, Aggregation

```sql
SELECT store_name, store_id, SUM(qty) AS total_sales,
  CASE
    WHEN SUM(qty) > 2000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN SUM(qty) BETWEEN 500 AND 2000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS store_performance
FROM global_sales
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Level:

### 1. Average Payment Value for Customers with >3 Orders
**Skill Used:** JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, Aggregation

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, COUNT(s.order_id) AS total_order,
       AVG(s.quantity * s.price_per_unit) AS avg_payment_value
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN sales s ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN payments pm ON pm.order_id = s.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
HAVING COUNT(s.order_id) > 3;
```

---

### 2. Rank Products Within Each Store by Sales Quantity
**Skill Used:** CTE, DENSE_RANK, Window Functions

```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
  SELECT product_id, product_name, store_name, store_id, SUM(qty) AS quantity_sold
  FROM global_sales
  GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
)
SELECT store_name, product_name, quantity_sold,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY store_id ORDER BY quantity_sold DESC) AS d_rank
FROM product_sales;
```

---

### 3. Categorize Product Price Above/Below Category Average
**Skill Used:** CTE, JOIN, CASE WHEN, Aggregation

```sql
WITH t1 AS (
  SELECT category, AVG(unit_price) AS avg_price
  FROM global_sales
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT product_id, product_name, gs.unit_price, t1.avg_price,
  CASE WHEN gs.unit_price > t1.avg_price THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END AS product_performance
FROM global_sales gs
INNER JOIN t1 ON t1.category = gs.category;
```

---

### 4. Get First Sale of Each Product in Each Store
**Skill Used:** ROW_NUMBER, Window Functions

```sql
WITH product_sale AS (
  SELECT store_name, product_name, order_date,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY store_id, product_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_rk
  FROM global_sales
)
SELECT * FROM product_sale WHERE order_rk = 1;
```

---

### 5. Rank Stores by Total Revenue
**Skill Used:** RANK, Window Functions

```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
  SELECT store_id, store_name, SUM(net_sale) AS total_sales
  FROM global_sales
  GROUP BY 1,2
)
SELECT *, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales) AS d_rank
FROM product_sales;
```

---

## ðŸ”´ Hard Level:

**Skill Used:** CTE, DENSE_RANK, Partitioning

```sql
WITH product_sale AS (
  SELECT store_id, store_name, country, SUM(net_sale) AS total_revenue
  FROM global_sales
  GROUP BY 1,2,3
),
product_sale_rank AS (
  SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS d_rank
  FROM product_sale
)
SELECT * FROM product_sale_rank WHERE d_rank = 1;
```

---

### 2. Identify Top 3 Stores by Revenue per Country

```sql
WITH product_sale AS (
  SELECT store_id, store_name, country, SUM(net_sale) AS total_revenue
  FROM global_sales
  GROUP BY 1,2,3
),
product_sale_rank AS (
  SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS d_rank
  FROM product_sale
)
SELECT * FROM product_sale_rank WHERE d_rank <= 3
ORDER BY country;
```

## Questions & Feedback

Feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions. Here's an example query for reference:

### Example Query
**Question**: Retrieve the total sales revenue for each store in a specific country.

SELECT 
    s.store_name, 
    SUM(sales.qty * sales.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    sales
JOIN 
    stores s ON sales.store_id = s.store_id
